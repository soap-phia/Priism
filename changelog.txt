== 1.2 dev [2025-05-20] ==
Fixed some major flaws with Priism. Images and disk detection have been reworked entirely.
Fixed PRIISM_IMAGES resizing (growpart issues).
Removed stateful detection logic from installcros(). chromeos-recovery finds internal storage automatically.

Updated the name "Archimax" in credits to "xmb9".
Removed Ethereal Workshop branding (1/2)

== 1.1 stable [2025-02-05] ==
Updated installcros() to fix installing recovery images on ChromeOS versions above ~113.
Added "payloads" menu. Quick and dirty replacement for those who needed some things that shims provide but not all.

== 1.0 stable [2025-01-15] ==
Priism is now MUCH more (skid)user-friendly. 
Added update_device.sh script.

== 0.9a [2025-01-12] ==
Rebranded from "CROSMIDI" to "Priism".
Fixed recovery (kernel priority is now set).
Added auto-resizer inside of Priism.

== 0.8 [2024-05-20] ==
Implemented installing recovery media.
Added builder. Uses a SH1MMER legacy (Oct 2024+) image as a base.

== 0.1 [2024-01-20] ==
Basic shim booting implementation added. Uses chroot. Kind of lame.
